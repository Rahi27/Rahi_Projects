 Heart Disease Prediction using K-Means
 • Developed an unsupervised machine learning model to analyze heart disease risk using the K-Means algorithm.
 • Processed and visualized the dataset to find optimal clusters using the elbow method.
 • Identified patients at risk by analyzing clustering results.
 • Evaluated model accuracy and minimized prediction errors.
 
 Student Performance Prediction
 • Predicted student performance using multivariate linear regression.
 • Converted categorical data to numerical form and split into training/testing sets.
 • Applied gradient descent to minimize error and iteratively update model parameters.
 • Implemented training and testing workflows to ensure accurate predictions.
 
 Gender Classification using Logistic Regression
 • Built a model to classify gender as male or female based on input features.
 • Used gradient descent to minimize errors and updated model parameters.
 • Tested model for accuracy and evaluated overall performance.
